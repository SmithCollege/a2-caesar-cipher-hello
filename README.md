## Reflection Questions

What was your favorite part of this assignment?

Hayley: My favorite part of the assignment was working with the group to figure out how we should code the cipher.

Vivian: My favorite part was discussing different strategies for implementing the cipher and figuring out which worked best.

What was most challenging about this assignment?

Hayley: The most challenging part for me was understanding how the shift in indeces work in the cipher and how gradle works.

Vivian: The most challenging part was understanding gradle and unit tests.

General comments on your experience with this assignment:

Hayley: This assignment was difficult to understand at first but over time it made more sense to me, and gave me a good idea of how arrays work.

Vivian: I think the assignment was helpful in understand our previous work with dynamic array. It was difficult(but ultimately helpful) working in a new environment(gradle, github classroom) with little instruction on how exactly to implement the cipher.
